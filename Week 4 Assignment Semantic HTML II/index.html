            <h3>When it all Started</h3>
            <p>Established in 2019, we are a brand dedicated to the showcasing of Hispanic trends, fashion, and creative articulation. Based out of Northern California, we strive to never assimilate. Vida Loca Clothing is synonymous to the way we live. What makes us distinct from others is that everyone is not our audience. We think, create, and design for those who live their lives the way that they see fit.</p>
    
            <h3>Why we did it</h3>
            <p>As members of our community, we are often imitated and rarely appreciated. Our culture, food, and colloquialism is dissected, diluted, repackaged, and then fed to groups of consumers who are unaware of what created this style of life. This is our attempt to remedy that... and to feed our masses an authentic, pure, and raw form of expression and creativity in the form of streetwear. The life of a foreigner as seen through this Californian lens. </p>

            <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
            <p>Our goal is that you feel a sense of pride and belonging when you purchase and wear one of these articles of clothing.</p>
            <p>We strive to create our own space where our ideas and culture are showcased to the rest of the world and have no interest in letting anyone else in on this secret.</p>
            <h2 id="end-quote">Welcome to our crazy life, you'll fit in just fine...</h2>
